# generator-html-5-bp [![NPM version][npm-image]][npm-url]
> A simple html5 & grunt setup for front end web development


## Installation

First, install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and generator-html-5-bp using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)).

```bash
npm install -g yo
npm install -g generator-html-5-bp
```

## Start

You can now run the generator:

```bash
yo html-5-bp
```

## Note:

If you wish to run the php generator you will be required to have the following installed on your machine.
 * PHP >= 5.5.9
 * Composer (Dependency manager)

Refer to these docs if you'd like to know more https://laravel.com/docs/5.1/installation


## Static HTML or PHP Application

Once the generator is up and running tou should see the following:

![Alt text](/readme/screenshots/1.png?raw=true)

At this point you only need to name the project. This will be the name of the directory the project will be scaffolded into.

![Alt text](/readme/screenshots/2.png?raw=true)

You have the option to generate a static html project (boilerplate) for front end development or a php application (laravel). Once the project has been scaffolded the npm installation will take place.


## GIT

After generation has been completed git will have been initialized. Add this your .gitignore file so that you don't add any unneccessary or redundant files.

```bash
dist/*
!dist/assets/

dist/assets/*
!dist/assets/img/
!dist/assets/fonts/

dev/assets/css/*
*.DS_Store
*.sln
Web.config
*.sass-cache
node_modules
npm-debug.log
```
